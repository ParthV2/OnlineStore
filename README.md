Parameters To Test the Site:
The site can be tested without a username and password, as it is possible for a user to register/create an account.

We implemented the website using php and MySQL. This was done through cloud 9 (c9) service provider.

The website currently features a responsive user interface which was built from the ground up using bootstrap. The backend uses a Model/View/Controller (MVC) type structure to implement and run the website. It allows for user registration, login and log out. Additionally, it allows for users to be either just purchasers or both buyers and sellers. If a user opts to be a seller, they can add new products to the website via the sell page, and associate them with categories. All users can shop for products on the website. These products can be added to a shopping cart (which is stored within the session), and then when a user checks out, the stock of each of these products is update.  A user can update the shopping cart by adding new items or deleting items in the cart before check out. We have also implemented a my account page where sellers can update the current stock of their product (given a new shipment or increased inventory), and can edit their information. 

Have you implemented any additional features that are not included in the original topic specifications? 
-	My account page
-	Users and sellers can edit their account information and keep it up to date
-	Sellers can view and update the stock of each of their products
-	Responsive user interface and design
-	Users can register themselves on the website

Are there required features incomplete?
No, the required functionality of the site has all been implemented.
